# Machine Translation and Encoder-Decoder Model

🚀 **A deep learning-based machine translation system using an Encoder-Decoder architecture with Attention Mechanism. Deployed using Gradio.**

---

## **📌 Features**  
✅ Translates sentences from **English to Machine level Language**.  
✅ Uses a **Seq2Seq (Encoder-Decoder) architecture** with LSTM.  
✅ Implements an **attention mechanism** for better translation accuracy.  
✅ **Evaluates translation quality** using BLEU score.  
✅ **Deployed as a web app** using Gradio.  

---

## **📊 Evaluation Metrics**  
The translation quality is evaluated using:  
✅ **BLEU Score**: Measures the accuracy of translations compared to human references.
